Tal Brauner and Elad maman 

Design inspiration: 
Our design inspiration was taken from the design of tree star wars ships : 
1. An old Rebuplic ship - The "Tranperent".

Design Steps: 
1. The body - Each face of the ship's body is a kite shape, and was inspired by the  "Tranperent" and the "x wing starfighter".
2. The wings - Each wing is a part of a half circle and was inspired by the "Millennium Falcon". 
3. The cockpit - The cockpit was inspired by the  "x wing starfighter" and from the modern Fighter aircraft - like a kite shape with enough width and length for one or two persons to set in.  
 
Random Details:
1. The body size - front, back, and sizes length. 
2. The wings - radius length and max angle were the part circle ends.
3. The ship height - cockpit height and the length between the body and wings upper face and bottom face. 

What would we improve given more time?
we would improve our mash by adding more details like a hole for the window, a container for the gas tank, wheels for landing, an antenna for receiving and transmitting data, missile launcher.
